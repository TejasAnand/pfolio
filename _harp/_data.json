Inspecting the source of existing webpages can help illustrate concepts, but such webpages are typically too complex to serve as useful learning materials. Drawing inspiration from prior research in both software engineering and the learning sciences, we present a new web inspection tool capable of pruning irrelevant CSS and identifying implicit dependencies between properties.
