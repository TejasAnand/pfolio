I am a research intern at [Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/), working with [Gavin Smyth](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/gavinsmy/) and [Si√¢n Lindley](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sianl/) in the Future of Work group within [Human Experience and Design](https://hxd.research.microsoft.com/). Starting in October, I will join the [Early Product Development](https://medium.com/khan-academy-early-product-development) group at [Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.org) as a software engineer and researcher.

My research interests broadly intersect human-computer interaction (HCI), programming languages, software engineering, and computing education. I particularly enjoy working on **developer tools** and **programming environments** to scaffold and support **non-expert programmers**.

I recently graduated with a BA in Computer Science from [Northwestern University](http://eecs.northwestern.edu), where I was supervised by [Haoqi Zhang](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq), [Nell O'Rourke](http://www.eleanorourke.com), and [Jason Hartline](https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/). My studies were generously supported by the Google Lime Scholarship, Palantir Women in Technology Scholarship, Microsoft Tuition Scholarship, and Box Engineering Diversity Scholarship. Thanks, companies!

Lately (or not-so-lately), I've gotten into browser engines, type systems, [crossword puzzles](https://twitter.com/soylentqueen/status/1002202872266874880), classical music and jazz, policy debate, [document preparation](https://pandoc.org/), cognitive disability advocacy, and [certain](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild) [video](http://www.celestegame.com/) [games](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki). Most people call me Slim, and you should feel free to do so as well.
