I am a researcher, software engineer, and designer living in San Francisco.
I work on tools for thought at [Notion](https://notion.so/about).
Previously, I was part of the [Early Product Development](https://early.khanacademy.org/) research group at [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org) and the [Human Experience and Design](https://hxd.research.microsoft.com/) group at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/).

My research interests span programming languages, human factors, learning sciences, and personal computing.
I&rsquo;m interested in _programming languages as user interfaces_: in short, how language design affects the way people think about and write programs.
For instance, I ask questions about the usability of static and gradual [type systems](https://twitter.com/soylentqueen/status/1140838786043002881), the role of functional programming within computing education, and how provable guarantees might alleviate cognitive load while writing software. 

I received my BA in Computer Science from [Northwestern University](http://northwestern.edu), concentrating in human-computer interaction and theoretical computer science. Through [Design, Technology, and Research](http://dtr.northwestern.edu/), I researched [CSS inspection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2dFxxBh2K4) with [Haoqi Zhang](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq) and [Nell O&rsquo;Rourke](http://www.eleanorourke.com). Through the [CS Theory](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/) group, I researched [peer grading algorithms](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1733860) with [Jason Hartline](https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline).
My studies were generously supported by scholarships from [Google](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/scholarships/google-lime-scholarship/), [Microsoft](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/usscholarshipprogram), [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/students/scholarship/wit-north-america/), [Box](http://www.boxdiversityscholarship.com/), and [Quip](https://quip.com/scholarship), among others.

I really like browser engines, type systems, public transit, [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), [crossword puzzles](https://twitter.com/soylentqueen/status/1002202872266874880), classical music, policy debate, [document preparation](https://pandoc.org/), cognitive disability advocacy, the Nintendo Switch, hiking, and critical theory.

Most people call me Slim; you should feel free to do the same.
