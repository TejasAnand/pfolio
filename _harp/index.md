I am a research intern in the [Human Experience and Design](https://hxd.research.microsoft.com/) group at [Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/), working with [Gavin Smyth](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/gavinsmy/) and [Si√¢n Lindley](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sianl/) on projects related to the future of work.
Starting in October, I will join the [Early Product Development](https://medium.com/khan-academy-early-product-development) group at [Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.org) as a software engineer and researcher.

My research interests intersect programming languages, human-computer interaction (HCI), software engineering, and computing education.
I want to build tools to **help non-expert programmers understand programming languages more deeply**: their design principles, semantics, and abstractions.
I'm particularly interested in the curiously-maligned (or perhaps just underexplored) role of **functional programming within computing education**.

I recently graduated with a BA in Computer Science from [Northwestern University](http://eecs.northwestern.edu), where I researched CSS inspection with [Haoqi Zhang](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq) and [Nell O'Rourke](http://www.eleanorourke.com), and peer grading algorithms with [Jason Hartline](https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/).
My studies were generously supported by scholarships from [Google](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/scholarships/google-lime-scholarship/), [Microsoft](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/usscholarshipprogram), [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/students/scholarship/wit-north-america/), [Box](http://www.boxdiversityscholarship.com/), and [Quip](https://quip.com/scholarship).
Thank you, companies!

Lately (or not-so-lately), I've gotten into browser engines, type systems, [crossword puzzles](https://twitter.com/soylentqueen/status/1002202872266874880), classical music and jazz, policy debate, [document preparation](https://pandoc.org/), cognitive disability advocacy, and [certain](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild) [video](http://www.celestegame.com/) [games](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki).

Most people call me Slim, and you should feel free to do so as well.
