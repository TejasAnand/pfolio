I am a researcher, technologist, and designer living in San Francisco. I currently work at [Notion](https://notion.so/about), designing and building [tools for thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tools_for_Thought). Previously, I was part of the [Early Product Development](https://early.khanacademy.org/) group at [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org); [Human Experience and Design](https://hxd.research.microsoft.com/) at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/); and [Design, Technology, and Research](http://dtr.northwestern.edu/) at [Northwestern University](http://northwestern.edu).

My research interests span programming languages, human factors, learning sciences, and personal computing.
I&rsquo;m interested in _programming languages as user interfaces_ and tools for thought: in short, how language design affects the way people think about and write programs.
For instance, I ask questions about the usability of static and gradual type systems, the role of functional programming within computing education, and how provable guarantees might alleviate cognitive load while writing software.

I graduated with a BA in Computer Science from [Northwestern University](http://northwestern.edu), where I researched CSS inspection with [Haoqi Zhang](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq) and [Nell O&rsquo;Rourke](http://www.eleanorourke.com) and peer grading algorithms with [Jason Hartline](https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/).
My studies were generously supported by scholarships from [Google](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/scholarships/google-lime-scholarship/), [Microsoft](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/usscholarshipprogram), [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/students/scholarship/wit-north-america/), [Box](http://www.boxdiversityscholarship.com/), and [Quip](https://quip.com/scholarship), among others.

I really like browser engines, type systems, public transit, [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), [crossword puzzles](https://twitter.com/soylentqueen/status/1002202872266874880), classical music, policy debate, [document preparation](https://pandoc.org/), cognitive disability advocacy, the Nintendo Switch, hiking, and critical theory.

Most people call me Slim; you should feel free to do the same.
