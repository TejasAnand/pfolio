I go by Slim. I am a software engineer and researcher in the [Early Product Development](https://medium.com/khan-academy-early-product-development) group at [Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.org), working on open problems in education technology.
Previously, I interned at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/), where I collaborated with [Sean Rintel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/serintel/) and [Gavin Smyth](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/gavinsmy/) on projects related to the future of work.

My research interests span programming languages, human factors, and computing education.
I'm interested in _programming languages as user interfaces_: in short, how language design affects the way people think about and write programs.
Within that space, I'm particularly interested in the usability of static and gradual type systems, and the role of functional programming within computing education.

I recently graduated with a BA in Computer Science from [Northwestern University](http://eecs.northwestern.edu), where I researched CSS inspection with [Haoqi Zhang](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq) and [Nell O'Rourke](http://www.eleanorourke.com) and peer grading algorithms with [Jason Hartline](https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/).
My studies were generously supported by scholarships from [Google](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/scholarships/google-lime-scholarship/), [Microsoft](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/usscholarshipprogram), [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/students/scholarship/wit-north-america/), [Box](http://www.boxdiversityscholarship.com/), and [Quip](https://quip.com/scholarship).
Thank you, companies!
